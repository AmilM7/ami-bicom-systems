<h1>AMI application<h1>

The idea for this application is to create a simple dashboard that will track the number of Users (total number of asterisk Extensions), the number of active users (number of registered Extensions), and ongoing calls.
The GUI is simple and is done using the Semantic UI framework. The application does not use a database, all the data are shown in real-time.
